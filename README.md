# Get It Done (Hack Quarantine)
A productivity web app that helps keep track of assignments and due dates for each teacher. Also 
keeps teacher's contact info all in one place to allow for easy submission of work

## Info
This is an attempt at the Hack Quarantine Hackathon on [Devpost](https://hackquarantine.devpost.com/?ref_content=default&ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=portfolio)

I am using React for the frontend of this web app, and Firebase to deal with the backend

## Who is this for?
Students who needs to keep track of all of their assignments and send them to their teachers when ready
